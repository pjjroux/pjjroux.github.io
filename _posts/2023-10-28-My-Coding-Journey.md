![Main]({{ "/images/journey.png" | absolute_url }})

Seven years ago, I jumped into the coding world, eyes wide with anticipation and a tangible sense of nervousness. It was all new, a little scary but exciting. I even scribbled down my adventure in a [blog post](https://pjjroux.github.io/My-First-Year/), sharing the highs and lows of my first coding year.

Fast forward to now, I’m sitting in the Lead Developer chair. It's a different game with a view filled with experiences, challenges, and a sea of code that tells my story. Every project, every bug, and every fix has pushed me deeper into this tech universe.

The ride from writing simple scripts to leading a team of developers has been wild. My toolkit has grown, packed with different languages, frameworks, and loads of lessons learned along the way.

My desk, once a solo coding station, now is a place where mentoring, planning, and reviewing code happens. I’ve got a team to look after, code quality to maintain, and projects to steer towards the finish line, all while still diving into code to solve tough problems.

The doubts that used to bug me have turned into a layer of expertise, but the hunger to learn and grow hasn’t budged. Every day brings new hurdles, new solutions, and fresh learnings, keeping the coder in me alive and kicking.

Looking back, the rollercoaster of late-night bug fixes, the cheer of seeing my code work, and the hurdles crossed, I see a journey filled with learning and growth. The world of code is huge, and I’m just a part of it, crafting digital stuff with a team of awesome coders.

As I step further into this journey, with a solid team beside me, the adventure continues. The code that used to puzzle me is now my friend, and together we march on, crafting digital solutions that matter, making a mark, one line of code at a time.

## Embracing Architecture and DevOps: The Next Chapter

The transition into architecture and DevOps work has sparked a new level of excitement in me. It’s like opening a new book, filled with complex, intriguing plots waiting to be unraveled. The realms of architecture and DevOps promise a blend of creativity, efficiency, and a dash of the unknown, ... propelling me further into the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) field.

This new chapter is not just about embracing new roles or tasks, it’s about taking a significant stride in my career and life. The blend of architecture’s big-picture thinking and DevOps’ streamlined processes is like a new playground waiting to be explored. I am thrilled to dive into this, embracing the challenges, and celebrating the victories that lie ahead. This is more than just a career shift; it’s a journey of growth, learning, and continuous evolution, and I am all here for it.
