title: "From Tasks to Trust: My Ongoing Lesson as a Leader"
---

_This year I’m on a course that’s been pushing me to think differently about leadership._

One thing has been very clear: I’ve been too focused on tasks and deliverables, and not enough on people. I realized that I don’t always make the time to really listen to my team. I jump straight into what needs to be done, what’s next on the board, what deadlines are coming up.  

It feels productive in the moment, but it comes at a cost. Without real connection and trust, tasks alone don’t build strong teams. One of the facilitators on the course said something that stuck with me:  

> “We earn the right to reply.”  

It sounded simple, but it hit me hard. Too often I listen only to respond quickly or to move things forward.  

Earning the right to reply means slowing down, listening deeply, and really understanding before jumping in. That’s the kind of listening that builds trust. I’ve also seen moments where decisions are shaped more by ego or self-interest than by collaboration. When that happens, it can quietly create tension and make trust harder to build. Seeing that reminds me of the kind of leader I aspire not to be.
 
Tasks might get done in the short term, but long-term trust is lost. The truth is, leadership isn’t just about execution. It’s about creating an environment where people feel heard, valued, and trusted. And trust isn’t built on big promises and clever words, it’s built when we do what we say and say what we do. Consistency over time is what makes people believe in us.  

For me, this is a shift in mindset:  

- Less “what are you delivering?” and more “how are you doing?”  
- Less managing the board, more connecting with the person.  

I don’t have it all figured out, but I know this: tasks will always be there. Trust needs to be built. And I want to get better at that.  

To my team reading this, thank you for your patience as I learn and grow. I’m committed to building a better environment for us, and I know we can keep holding each other accountable to it. 

Looking forward, I’m excited about this journey, and I know there’s still so much to learn. My hope is that these lessons don’t just shape me, but also strengthen the team and culture around me.
